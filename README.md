TimeVault is a secure app that allows users to encrypt and store photos and text messages. Users can set a specific date for the content to be decrypted and accessible. TimeVault handles the rest, from the secure on-device AES-256 bit encryption, to the memory manager vault. It does all of this while having a clean user interface that anybody can use.
